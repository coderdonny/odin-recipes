        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>These blueberry muffins are the best and they come out perfectly every time I bake them.  You can use fresh blueberries or frozen – substitute cranberries and orange zest for the holiday season or stick with the classic blueberry and lemon that I love.  Don’t have lemon?  Try orange or lime zest.  You can’t go wrong here.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ Cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1¼ cups sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups + 1 tablespoon flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 cups blueberries (frozen or fresh)</li>
            <li>zest of one lemon</li>
            <li>raw sugar (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2>Directions</h2>

            <li>Add vanilla and one egg at a time, mixing between each addition.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
            <li>Alternate the dry ingredients with the milk into the butter mixture, mixing on low until completely incorporated. Careful not to overmix the batter.</li>
            <li>Place berries in your dry ingredients bowl.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon flour to the berries, gently shaking the bowl to evenly coat without crushing the fruit.</li>
            <li>Add berries to batter along with the zest of a lemon and gently fold in.</li>
